 
Hill Fortress' walls are located about 1.5 km north-west on the road to the center of Debelets, Cholakovtsi district of Veliko Tirnovo. The ascent "Hill" is located on the right hand of the road, above 100 meters after leaving the town of Debelets. The Castle was used as tower surveillance and guard tower for the old Roman road, caming from Nicopolis ad Istrum. 
 
The fortress is situated so as to have a beautiful view to south and to have the possibility to control the traffic of the old road to the valley of the river. Probably it served as a watch and guard tower for the old roman road caming from Nikopolis ad Istrum. The Hill is not to high but there is steep slopes on all sides, and only a narrow path separates it from the surrounding land to the northeast. On top of the hill is observed as remnants of stone construction, built of crushed stone. 
 
It is assumed that the fortress was built in the late fourth century. Her abandonment may be related to Slavic-Avar attacks at the end of VI century and beginning of VII century.
