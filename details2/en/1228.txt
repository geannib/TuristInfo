The beautiful land of Ostrov has concealed and sent from ancient times a culture of the vine plants and of the wine, which was brought again to life by the new owners of S.C. Ostrovit S.A.
The Ostrov domains are situated in the south-west of the county of Constanța, along the right shore of the Danube, on the superior terrace, having a length of 30 km. The wines obtained in this cellar have particularities of noblesse and originality, which give them a strong and distinguished personality. The wines of the Ostrov cellar follow and promote the quality requests of the European Union. The archeological sources have shown us the fact that, even 3000 years ago, the region known today as Ostrov was synonymous with the wine growing and, consequently, with the wine making. Over time, under different forms, at Ostrov there was produced wine. 
The cultivation was made on big surfaces, which imposed the wine growing as being a distinguished element for the future Roman province. After the conquest of Dacia, the Roman administration introduced new types of vine plants and new methods of cutting and wine making practices. The cultivation of the vine plants never stopped, even in the period of the migration of the populations, not even in the centuries of the Turkish occupation of the Romanian Countries.
The cultivation of the vine plants for the Romans belongs not only to the manual work, but also to an entire spirituality, art and line of thought, which strongly marked this civilization. The wine is found in diverse artistic creations and in the Roman sculptures and everything lies under the mark of Bachus, who, according to the legend, had wine in his veins, instead of blood. The discoveries made in the area revealed more representations of Bachus and of the grape bunch. 
The wine producer, Ostrov Domains, is governed by the business man, Horia Culcescu, starting with the year 2001. Starting with 2005 until present, at the Ostrov Domains, were performed investments for the re-conversion of the plantations, through successive annual programs, irrigation systems, the endowment with equipments and specific facilities. Also, the two wine making stations Ostrov, respective Lipnița, have been brought to modern standards. 
The Ostrov Domains represent the brand under which Ostrovit S.A. produces the wines from the Ostrov vineyard.
