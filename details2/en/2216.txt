Edward and Elisabeth Haskell were American missionaries who arrived in the village of Pordim in the beginning of 20th century. The couple helped the local people to gain skills in the winery, gardening, woodwork, silk culture and livestock breeding for the men, and cooking and tailoring for the women. They also educated the children while their parents were working on the corn fields. The villagers built a grave stone in their memory as a sign of thankfulness.
