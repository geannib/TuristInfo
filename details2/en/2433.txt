Pelikovo fountain is situated on the main road that crosses through the village. It was built of local stone by Abazi Turks before 1856, when the Muslim population escaped from the village and was abandoned. Just 30 years later, ten Bulgarian families from Olteni≈£a returned to liberated Bulgaria and settled here. Fountain is also called "the hot spring" because years ago, after the earthquake the water was running warm. In 2015 the water was tested again and proved once again to be good for consumption and that it has very good properties.
