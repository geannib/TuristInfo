The trail starts on the main road Mezdra â€“ Sofia and follows the river Kamenitsa. Climbing further up takes you to Staro Selo neighbourhood and the Church of the Most Holy Mother of God, built back in 1492. Information boards along the trail tell the stories of the locality and the men who used to live here. From this point it takes 30 minutes to walk to the village of Milanovo or 2 hours to Parshevitsa Hut.
