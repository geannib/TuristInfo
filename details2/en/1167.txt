Corneliu Virgiliu Medrea (born on the 8th of March 1888, Miercurea Sibiului – deceased on the 25th of July 1964, Bucharest) was a Romanian sculptor and sculpture professor, correspondent member of the Romanian academy.
Cornel Medrea was born in 1888 in the commune Miercurea Sibiului, in a family native from the commune Galda de Jos. After the high school studies at Alba Iulia and at the School of Arts and Crafts from Zlatna, Medrea attends the School of Decorative Art from Budapest (between 1909 – 1912), where he worked with the sculptor György Zala. Between the years 1912 – 1913, he carried on journeys in diverse European countries, visiting the museums of plastic arts.

The portrays, the series of maternities, the historical evocation (Dragoș Vodă and the Urus), the allegoric manifestations (Atlas, Fishermen, Victory) converge towards the manifestation of a plenitude, of an optimism based upon the manifestation of the human image.
