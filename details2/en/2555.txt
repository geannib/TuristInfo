 
The Zarapovo Waterfall is located near the village Visovgrad, a few meters  from the road to Veliko Turnovo of Pavlikeni. It is  relatively small, with a height of about 15 meters. There is a comfortable platform and two small bridges, from which you can enjoy the beautiful view.  A small geocomplex (can be called eco-alley) with the name of Zarapovo is built around the waterfall and there is a convenient place where you can stop to rest. 
 
The route to the waterfall starts behind the plate for Geocomplex. Walking is very pleasant in both directions and takes no more than 20 minutes. There is a separate area with benches, barbecue and oriel with a large table.
