For the international day of Danube river â€“ June 29th of each year a row boats march is organised each year including participants from the entire region. The route is agreed two weeks in advance and is in accordance with the level of the river and the prognosis of its fluctuation. It is adequate for the unexperienced people which can count on the experienced boaters for help. 
The Danube day gathers together people of all ages and with different physical training to know the river, to exercise and to make new friends. 
The march ends traditionally with a freshly cooked fish tasting and camping on the bank of the Danube. Every year the number of candidates is increasing and those who came once will return next year.
