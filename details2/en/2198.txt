Gushovski monastery is the ruin of a monastery that was located on a beautiful meadow - the starting point of the Chiprovtsi traditional MTB race, Trite chuki, which is held every year, on September. To reach this place you must climb onto a gravel road of almost 5km road and then the climbing continue towards the Aldentsi peak. Shortly afterwards the road is divided into two zones - a longer but easier blue route and a red steep route that goes straight up to the Deyanitsa site and back to the Gushovski monastery. The blue route on the other hand, will take you in a long hike around Kopilovtsi and it will, also take you back to Chiprovtsi.
