Heavy battles were fought here during the War of Liberation. Southwest of the village is General Lavrov Park and Museum, laid out in the locality, related to one of the most crucial periods of the siege of Pleven. A great number of Russian soldiers, headed by commander Colonel Lavrov, perished in the battles. Monuments of gratitude now rise here.
