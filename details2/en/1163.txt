Silos Anghel Saligny  built between 1904-1909 and 1912-1915 by engineer Anghel Saligny, are located in berths 17-18 of the Port of Constanţa, have a height of 45 meters and a storage capacity of 30.000 tons each.
The silos were designed by Anghel Saligny, following the plans of the architect Petre Antonescu.
The initial project provides the erection of 5 buildings: 4 silos and a grain dryer. In the end, only three silos were built silos and the dryer. Until 1909 were built the warehouses no. 1 and 2, and at  the 3rd and 4th being built only the foundations. The first silo was equipped with the installations for the silage of grains come in wagons. Before World War I,  works started on the third warehouse, works completed during 1924.
The buildings are made of brick and steel structure.
Neoclassical elements on the facades and the overall appearance are strongly inspired by the architecture from USA of that time.
According to Anghel  Saligny’s concept,  each silo includes 250 sections of reinforced concrete, with a total capacity of approx. 30.000 tons of grains and a rate of 125 tonnes per hour on receipt, and 200 tons per hour on delivery.
Saligny managed to devise a technology through which silos could be loaded, but also unloaded at the same time.
The large number of compartments and their smaller diameter make that at the time of loading the silo with grains of wheat, barley, corn, they do not shatter on impact with the walls and nor  during storage, by pressing to the wall of the silo.
Anghel I. Saligny (b. 19 April 1854, Şerbăneşti, Galaţi - d. 17 June, 1925, Bucharest), academician, civil engineer Romanian minister and teacher, is considered one of the pioneers of the worldwide tecnique in the design and construction of bridges and silos with metal structure, namely of reinforced concrete, one of the founders of the Romanian engineering.
He attended the first  school classes at the children boarding school from Focsani, founded by his father, Alfred Saligny, teacher of French origin from Alsace, established in Romania, then he attended his secondary education at the secondary school from Focşani, National College Unirea, from the same locality and later the high school in Germany, at Potsdam. Being initially drawn to astronomy, he attended the classes of the University of Berlin, having as professor the famous physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894). During  the period 1870 - 1874, he studied engineering at the Higher Technical School of Charlottenburg, with illustrious engineering professors Schwedler and Franzius. He worked, under the guidance of the Professor G. Mehrtens, to the construction of the railway Cottbus Frankfurt on Oder and under the management of Gh. Duca (during 1877-1879), to the construction of the railway Ploieşti-Predeal.
Other constructions:
- Bridge over Siret at Cosmeşti, 430 m long (1888)
- Builds for the first time in the world, the reinforced concrete silo in Brãila and Galaţi, designed in 1888 and constructed between 1890-1895 the bridge over Danube from Cernavodã.
