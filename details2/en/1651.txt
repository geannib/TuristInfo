Baptists are Christians who comprise a group of cults and churches following a doctrine that baptism is performed only to the people who had a confession of faith which must be done by immersion. Baptist Confession focuses on believer's baptism, which must take place by complete immersion after the confession of faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord. Other beliefs of Baptists are freedom of the soul, salvation by faith alone, the Bible as the sole authority and autonomy of the local church. Many Baptists believe in Protestantism, but there is historical evidence that contradicts this. Baptist World Alliance gives a total of more than 44 million members in approximately 150,000 congregations.
In 2002, there were more than 100 million Baptists around the globe and more than 33 million in North America. After the number of members worldwide, Baptists are the largest Christian denomination in comparison with other Protestant denominations.
