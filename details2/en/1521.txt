The Holy Apostles Peter And Paul Church is a beautiful architectural work, imposing and special as opposed to all others in the city and county. It is built in the shape of a cross with four towers, two big and two small, being well structured in the front with traditional bizantine forms and well balanced proportions.
Built with community donations, with city hall’s contribution and at the persistence and effort of the bishops, The Holy Apostles Peter And Paul Church was built between 1842 and 1845 from the wish of some warm founders of the town, who rest in the church courtyard. It was rebuilt between 1902 and 1904 and later restored between 1930 and 1934.
For its restoration, between 1902 and 1904, the paintings were also done by painter Gheorghe Ioanid, a disciple of the Tătărăscu school.
This restoration was also marked through a bronze and golden bronze handle medallion, 23 mm in diameter. Brought out in 1904, in 200 copies, 150 bronze pieces and 50 silver ones, the documentary and numismatics value piece was offered to the clergy and church congregation. The other 50 pieces were sold. 
The following legend is on the obverse: FOUNDED IN 1902 AND COMPLETED IN 1904 WITH THE COMMUNITY’S HELP, PRIEST PARRISH GHIȚĂ GEORGESCU’S EFFORT AND VESTRYMEN IVAN CHIRISA AND GHITA ANGELESCU
Between 1998 and 1999, by the care of priests Sandu Ion and Popa Mihai, the necessary radical repairs were done to this building, the tin that covered the enture church was replaced and a great part of the paintings were redone.
