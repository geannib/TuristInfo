In the center of the village there is found the monument built up as a tribute for the heroes who fell in the Second World War (1941 – 1945). This monument was built up in the year 1998 on the date of the 28th of May, with the help of the citizens from the commune and it was initiated by 9 inhabitants.
After a period of neutrality which lasted over a year (in which the Kingdom of Romania allowed the eviction of the Government, of the treasury and the Polish forces towards the British Egypt, but lost important territories in the profit of the allays from that period of Nazi Germany, namely URSS, Hungary and Bulgaria), Romania changes its allays together with the arrival at the power of Ion Antonescu. It allays with the Powers of the Ax in October 1940 and enters into war on their side in June 1941, with the purpose of regaining at least the territories taken by URSS: Basarabia, Northern Bucovina and the Land of Herța. After three years and two months of military campaigns against URSS, which take the Romanian army until the steppe from the north part of Caucasus and back, on the date of the 23rd of August 1944, the soviet army being already in Northern Moldavia starting with the month of March, King Michael I gives his approval for the oustering of the marshal Antonescu if he refuses to sign the armistice with the United Nations. Following the net refusal of Antonescu, King Michael I removed him and arrested him, and Romania passed onto the side of the Allays. The participation of Romanian to the Second World War was therefore characterized by two campaigns: the one for the East for freeing Basarabia and Bucovina, lost, and the one from the West for freeing Transylvania, won. At the end of the war, on a diplomatic plan, only the participation on the side of the Ax was taken into account and Romania signed the Peace treaty from Paris (1946) as a defeated enemy state.
The loses of Romania in the Second World War are usually estimated as being over 800 thousand, both civilians and militaries, although the statistics give different numbers. The most loses took place after the 22nd of June 1941, when the Nazi Germany invaded URSS.
The Romanian military loses were of approximately 300.000 people. The total of the deceased is of 93,326 (72.291 during the alliance with the Powers of the Ax and of 21.035 on the side of the allays): the total of the disappeared and of the prisoners is of 341.765 (288.322 during the alliance with the Powers of the Ax and 58.443 on the side of the allays) only 80.000 survived the captivity in the Soviet Union. The Russian sources mention the fact that 54.600 deceased of the 201.800 Romanian prisoners in the Soviet Union during the war. The numbers don’t include the 40.000 – 50.000 deceased in the Hungarian army.
The civilian loses are of 64.000 including 20.000 deceased during the Russian occupation of Basarabia and Bucovina from 1940 – 41 and the genocide of the Gypsy population – 36.000 deceased.
The raids of the allays provoked 7.693 deceased among the civilians.
