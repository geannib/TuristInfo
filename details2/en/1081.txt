The Sports Hall in Constanta was inaugurated in the late 50s. What makes it stand out is the architecture, although most people who designed the building in the communism era opted for a modernist style.
The building has:
- a polyvalent hall with 2,000 seats;
- Junkers playing surface type 900mp (22x44m)
- electronic table to display score
- STRAMATEL electronic scoreboard 
- ERHARD volleyball net
- SCHELDE basketball panels
- lockers
- conference rooms
- TV and radio transmission facilities
On the main front we can find two reliefs known as "Young Athletes". Crafted in bronze they are the sculptor's works Zoe Baicoianu  and were mounted on the building in 1960.
The "Young Athletes" highlight the aesthetic characteristics of the static and the dynamic art in general and sporting art in particular, but we will draw attention on  impression of perfection and beauty the motion  picture creates,  which the artist has depicted.
Zoe Băicoianu was the daughter of a lady of honor of the Royal Court.
He studied art in France at the School of Fine Arts in Paris, and was "habitable" (hosted) (1932-1933) and then she received a full scholarship (1937-1938) from Romanian School in Rome. Multilateral approach of occupations as manner of approach, as well as material occupations (metal, glass and so on.) she had and she has achieved a monumental and decorative art. In Paris she studied in 1937 with André Lhote. 
Zoe Baicoianu was a teacher at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest.
