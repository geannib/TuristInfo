The parish church Berkovitsa, was built in 1845. The building has a polygonal and very wide apse. The columns are made of massive stone. The balcony develops over the outside narthex, and on the north and on the south has long galleries. To the north the galleries of the church are being upgraded. The iconostasis is carved by the Teteven and Tryavna masters.
Typical of the church is the fact that the outside of the church imitates the architecture of a house, and constructed like this, the church is completely hidden among the other houses in the neighborhood. This is the only example of this type of the ecclesiastical architecture of the Renaissance.
