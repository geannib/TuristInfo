The association was created in 1891 under the name “The hunter”. The main activities of the hunting association were the fighting against the predators and poaching, as well as organizing shooting competitions (shooting glass balls and live pigeons in particular made rules). In 1930 the association bought the house of the businessman Metsoloou in the centre of the town of Pleven. Nowadays the house serves as a museum.
