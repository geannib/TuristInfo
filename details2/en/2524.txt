 
Pearly water Fountain is located approximately 500 m southeast of the center of Pushevo. It was restored in 2012, at the library council initiative "Spoluka-1923". There is a parking space  near the orchard. Water is considered by locals to be curative. 
 
Under running water in the picturesque canyon, a creek with beautiful basins, waterfalls and rock shelters  flows. There is also a fountain with a very high flow. 
 
And on the hill, on the western shore of the canyon, above the fountain, theer is a large  meadow  with beautiful  wild cactuses.
