For centuries the people of Tutrakan survived from two trades - fishing and boat building. In the 20th century there were over 1000 fishing boats in the harbour. Tutrakan is famous as the biggest fishing center on the Lower Danube and at the same time, is a major producer of river boats from central Europe to the black Sea. 
Today there aren't many families of fishermen but almost always you can find fresh fish. It can be purchased directly from fishermen or fish farms - only two of them were left. One of them is opposite to the port Tutrakan (Turtucaia) and the other is opposite to the boats harbour at the eastern end of the promenade.
Both fish markets supply local restaurants and fish shops around with fresh fish.
