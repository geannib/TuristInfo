From the centre of Medkovets quarter you have to reach the highest part on the outskirts of the quarter, and then turn to the left and cross the stream in Medkovski Dol. Here a stony cart track begins, turning and twisting and shortcutting the turns in the road, leading to the ravine in the foothills of Mount Sveta Gora. The track enters a wood and past several pens leads to a karst spring. The path now runs through pine woods and crossing a vast clearing with young pine plantation leads to a cart track in Tsarevo Livage locality. Walking through Izbata and Kleno localities, youâ€™d reach the monument near Mount Okolchitsa.
