Heroes Monument, the work of sculptor John Schmidt, from Bucharest is finished at the end of 1926 and was inaugurated on the day of the Ascension, July 2, 1927 on Heroes Day. It consists of three statuary bronze, placed on a plinth of stone brought from a quarry in the Apuseni Mountains. The plaque in front of the monument bears the following inscription:
„It is raised this monument in the eleventh year of the glorious reign of M.S. King Ferdinand I, year of salvation 1925, to glorify forever the momentum of the heroes from Romanati who, through the supreme sacrifice, contributed to abolition of slavery of brothers from Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia by making real the dream of centuries of unifying the borders of of Greate Romania. / 1916-18-19.“
After the Second World War, when the regime changed, this plaque was replaced with another one that says: 
„This monument was raised in 1925, to remember forever the momentum of heroes from Romanati  who contributed through their supreme sacrifice in the liberation of brothers from Transylvania from the yoke of Austro Hungarian monarchy, put in the service of German imperialism invader by making real the dream of centuries to unify Romania's borders.“.
On three bronze plaques are inscribed the names of the officers from Romanati  "dead heroes on the battlefield for their country during the war in 1916-1919".
Romania's participation in World War I includes all measures and actions of a political, diplomatic and military order carried out by the Romanian state, alone or with allies, between July 28, 1914 and November 11, 1918, to achieve the main political purpose - achievement of Romanian national state .
In terms of the status of belligerency, Romania was: neutral country during the period July 28, 1914 - August 27, 1916, belligerent country on the Entente side between August 27, 1916 - November 27, 1917, in a state of truce between November 27, 1917 - May 7, 1918, noncombatant country between May 7, 1918 - November 9, 1918, belligerent country on the Entente side between November 9, 1918 - November 11, 1918.
In August 1916, Romania received an ultimatum to decide whether to join the Entente "now or never". 
Under the pressure of the ultimatum, the Romanian government accepts to enter the war on the Entente side, although the situation on the fronts of battle was not of the best.
Romania joined the war in an unpropitious moment. It is appreciated that if it had entered the war on the Entente side in 1914 or 1915 would have prevented the conquest of Serbia. In early 1916, the Romanians could have helped Brusilov Offensive. The main cause of Romania's delay to enter into the war was because the quasi-distrust of romanian political and military leaders in Russia.
