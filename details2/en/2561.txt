Before the eyes, a lovely view reveals to the the highest mountain - top Chumerna / 1536 m and the valley of Elena. After crossing the slum Hristovtsi a small path takes you to the natural SITE - Hristovtsi Waterfall. The Miikovska River  forms a syncline and waterfalls have a speed of 5 meters, gradually shifted by the rock formations. The west wall of the riverbed means steep cliffs, where with the help of experienced instructors one can descend  through the alpine rappelling (coborâri pe coardă) until the river.
