Stalpishte area is on the banks of the Danube River, takes its name from Stalbove - upright stones, large and small, thrown there by King Marko and his sister. Sometime there was a Bulgarian cultural center and obeservator old, whose memory is preserved in the name Mechka and stone models of Ursa Minor and Ursa Mari.
Nearby are ponds that are home to colonies of birds. The place is a migratory stop on the road "Via Pontica". Armed with your binoculars and get closer to ponds - you may want to count birds. How much did you get? Divide in mind most sectors of equal size, count birds in one of them, and multiply the result by the number of other sectors. Good luck.
There beach. On weekends people come with tents, trying to catch some fish.
