It represent a natural, maybe the most attractive and intriguing phenomenon in Bulgaria, due to their unusual strange shapes, arranged in three groups â€“ Adam and Eve, Horse Rider, the Castle, the Bear, the Schoolgirl, the Madonna, the Camel, the Mushrooms (located in the eastern part of the town) and Borich, Eyupriya (lying to the west of Belogradchik). The third group of rocks lies at about 4km from the town and includes the rocks around the Latin Gate, near the Lepenishka cave. The rocks date about 200 million years ago and lie on an area that stretches over about 30 km long and 3 km wide.
