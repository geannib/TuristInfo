The clock tower from Svishtov was built at the entrance on the commercial street by master Bogdan in 1763 for the needs of the working people in Svishtov. An inscription in Arabic on two marble plaques offers details about its building. The tower consists in a main building and a double wood superstructure.  In 1890 a new clock made in Austria was installed. 
Svishtov’s Tower Clock is a cultural monument of national importance.
