Dobruja house in Garvan village offers traditional architecture, a preserved mill and an ethnographic exhibition of households. The house is located in the center of the village, it has a large yard with flower beds, suitable for play and relaxation. The ground floor is a tavern typical for Bulgarian Renaissance and on the first floor there is an ethnographic exhibition and a guestroom.

The house was built in 1919 in typical Dobruja style Dobrogea Danube. It was privately owned by Dimitar Kudinov, a local villager of average wealth. During the socialist regime in 1982 it was bought by the Municipality of Garvan and functioned as an art center. Subsequently was used as a display center for authentic Dobruja traditions and folklore. 
After the political changes in Bulgaria and the difficult years of transition for the house, no funds were allocated for restauration and maintenance which led to its abandonment. In 2006, Municipalities of Garvan and Glavinitsa manage to provide funds for a partial repair and the house is revitalized.
Until now, the building has been strengthened and renovated. With the help of locals, the rooms are furnished in the Dobruja style 100 years ago- sofas, fireplace, traditional suits, wedding towels, rugs and other objects from the everyday life of the people in the past.
The complex has a large lounge, three bedrooms / beds - 5 places in total / bathroom, kitchen and a banquet hall with a capacity of 15 seats.
In 2007, the house was opened to receive volunteers from Spain, Poland and Bulgaria. Young people have stayed here for two weeks with all facilities offered by the house.
