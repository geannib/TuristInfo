Many times, the red army monuments (especially when the statuie is of a single soldier) are called „Alyosha”. 
In the city of Ruse, the Soviet Soldier Monument (Alyosha) depicts a standing Russian  soldier, holding a flag in his left hand and supporting the handle with his feet. On the pedestal are placed a pentagram and an inscription. On the back of the monument is a quote from Georgi Dimitrov:  ”USSR Friendship with Bulgaria is necessary as air and sun for every living creature”.  It was built in 1947, after a national competition. The project approved belongs to a team of authors led by Yordan Krachmarov..

The monument is at the crossroads  at the end of the street „Aleksandrovska”.  The Youth Park starts from below it.
