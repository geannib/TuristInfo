One of the biggest summer events on the Danube river happens in Tutrakan in late July in a completely renovated riverside park. "Danube on Fire" is the highlight of the week and is held annually on the river. During the festival a lot of cultural and sport events happen. On the last day takes place a traditional celebration of the river, including contests with fishing boats, swimming across the Danube, culinary competitions for the most delicious fish soup, grilled fish and the best prepared fish. The celebration is accompanied by animations, exhibitions, outdoor performances of music and dance schools. Every year there are new surprises such as riding scooters, paragliding, boat trips between Tutrakan and Oltenita, outdoor opera and more.
In the evening the dam becomes a stage for rock concerts, and after the night falls a light show starts on the river - "Danube of Fire", which ends with spectacular fireworks over the river.
