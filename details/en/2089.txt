On one side and on the other of Fountainâ€™s road white and anyone who goes here, goes, or returns to, stops at the Fountain to drink. And maybe sometimes somebody will say, but each soul is gratitude and praise to the one who made the fountain and whose mouth forever whisper the names the three streams ".
