 
Hill Mount Athos is located in Veliko Tirnovo and was a cultural and educational center of the old capital, but also throughout southeastern Europe. Today here is the University from Veliko Tirnovo. Among the vegetation stand out special routes, banks and the playground, and sometimes events are organized and motorcycles events. 
 
The hill is called Mount Athos, because in the Middle Ages there were several monasteries, including the monastery "St. Mary Odigitria" in which Evtimii from Tirnovo moved his literary school from the "St. Trinity" Monastery. About Mount Athos Gregory Tsamblak wrote: "In the city of Tirnovo there is a separated place only by  river. It can be senn in its entirety and full of grass and watering is done with plenty of flowing water and before you enjoy the taste, your eyes are delighted with voluntary beauties;  grew an extensive, dense and cold forest, and it is filled with all fruits and various flowers". From all rivers of Mount Athos, which Gregory Tsamblak  described,today there is no spring left of those described. In the first decades of the XXth century only one stream (so-called Black River) descended and spill into the Yantra River up to Veliko Tirnovo water-station. Near the monastery "St. Mary Odigitriya" is a well "The Well without stones". The road, walking beside the Dark Stream was called the "Wine Route" because  it went across the river directly to the Marmara vineyard. On this road was Feverish  Fountain. The water was taken from it to treat the pacient of feaver.
