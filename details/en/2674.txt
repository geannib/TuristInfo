The only remnant of the ancient village church, "St. Trinity" was built in 1866, and is located 2.5 km away from the village of Borovitsa, to the west. We have here frescoes, icons and a wooden altar. The high bell tower rises above the picturesque valley among the rocks and woods. Within the church is a building that was used for the school.
