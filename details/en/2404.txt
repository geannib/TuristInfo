The hill is located near Dulovo city at only one km north at the beginning of the dry valley in “Setea” Park.  A small memorial sculpture of Georgi Radulov is placed at the entrance. The hill and its surrounding areas were inhabited since the antiquity, continuing with the middle east and the ottoman period. To prove it there are the ceramics, the coins, the weapons and the houses found there. In the past there was a river crossing by with a lot of springs. Today it is a water capturing area.
