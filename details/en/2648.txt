With great cultural and historical significance and subject of mass tourist visits is a place called "Anishte" which is next to the road Salas - Belogradchik, 2 km east of the village Graniceak, Vidin. Here are the remains of ancient destroyed settlements, representing a separate building that has 4 rooms. There were found numerous fragments of pottery, coins and jewelry. It is believed that this is a Roman villa located on the road Ratsiaria-Naissus (today Nis), probably destroyed by the barbarian invasions at the end of third century and early IVth century.
