One of the most attractive historical sites is the late Roman archaeological complex Gamzigrad with the fortress Felix Romuliana, located at about 11 km from the town of Zajecar. The palace was built upon the order of Emperor Gaius Valerius Galerius Maximianus (297-311) at the end of the III century AD and the beginning of the IV century AD. It was dedicated to the mother of the ruler the so called “Merry Romuliana”.
