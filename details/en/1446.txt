After 1945 the museum grows in importance and widens its research area, being called the Porțile De Fier Region Museum.
On May 15th 1972 the museum opened in its current format, with two sections: history and natural sciences, with an aquarium where Danube fish species are displayed. Later on the sections of ethnography and art were created.
It displays pieces from the following domains: natural sciences (fauna and flora, aquarium for the Danube fauna and exotic fish), history – documents, archeology (including a funeral stone from the Roman era), numismatics, ethnography (costumes, ceramics, fabrics in the area), Romanian art (works by Luchian, Petrașcu, Pallady, Tonitza, Dimitrescu, Șirato, Stoenescu, Iser, Ressu)
The history archeology section is made up of nine rooms: - Prehistory – the remains of the material and spiritual lives of the Schela Cladovei culture;
