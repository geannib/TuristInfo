Belogradchik fortress occupies a strategic place in the Balkans - next to the "Saint Nicholas" and "Kadu-Boaz.". The construction takes place in the first and third century AD as a small shelter-fortress.  The builder used skillfully the elliptical inaccessible edge for "the first plate" and the performant functions of defense, surveillance, security and communication tools organized inside the facility.

During his reign the fortress has been additionally strengthened and expanded. There are two parts / from the southeast and northwest / with auxiliary facilities. Wooden suspended bridges and stairways of stone, give more opportunities for rapid maneuver. For the first time the name of the city was mentioned by Hungarian that describes the march of Lyudovig I Anzhuy. The chronicle indicates that after three months from the conquest of Vidin, in June 1365 were also captured other cities in the area, including Fortress Fehervar / Belogradchik /. Housed in a garrison, he was banished in 1369 by the Bulgarian insurgency. In 1396 Belogradchik fortress was conquered by the Ottomans and was partially destroyed. In 1454-1455 it was placed in the guard of 8 people, and a hundred years later, the garrison already had 27 soldiers and a Dizdar head. At the beginning of the 19th century the new masters made only minor repairs and improvements to the fort. The complete reconstruction along with its expansion, began in 1805 by french engineers and was completed in 1837 by the italians engineers. The walls reach a height of 12 meters, 2.5 meters wide at the base and are well reinforced with blocks of white stone against mortars. The routes ensure the speed and mobility in defense.
In the form of three fortified courtyards with three massive buried gates with iron bars. The defense capacity of the fortress was reinforced by three places for cannons and three cannon  platforms.
In the immediate vicinity there is the underground storage of food and ammunition. The guard of the fortress was placed, during a period, into three guard rooms, equipped with stone fireplaces and chairs. The fortified street and the first entire courtyard are cobbled  having an important economic significance. Near by were small size buildings for housing, workshops, stables for weapons. The free space of the second courtyard is occupied by the flour mill and stables. The water needs were satisfied from a well located in the southern part of the middle yard and by two tanks dug into the rock which collected the rainwater. Important for the protection of the fortress is the defensive belt from outside, including the dug solid fence having the pillars from the ground and baskets filled with stones and earth.
To strengthen the western sector of the fortification system built in 1862, was, therefore, raised the Suleymanov fort.
