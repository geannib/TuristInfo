Each year, the traditional procession starts from the church of St. Dumitri towards the Danube, where the Bishop of Vidin throws a cross in the river. Traditionally an odd number of people dive to catch it. It is believed that the first one who will catch it will be very strong. In the past, a man who caught the cross was richly rewarded by the villagers.
