In the case of "house Stakevskite", the complex offers great opportunities for recreation and entertainment in nature. Stakevtsy village is one of the few places in Bulgaria kept virgin, which became like a second home for our family. The nostalgia for living in a village made our choice easy. Charmed by the mountains Stakevci, fresh mountain air filled with the smell of herbs and fresh grass and the murmur of the river, we decided to make this complex so that everyone could enjoy all these things, to enjoy the peaceful nights, filled with cricket songs and fireflies lights!
"Stakevskite House‚Äù is composed of three houses - each has a private landscaped garden, illuminated, water area, barbecue and various leisure opportunities. Guests have a conference room and a dining room with 28 seats, which has a TV, sound system, fireplace, barbecue and a fully equipped kitchen that you can use by yourself. Without additional charge you can enjoy table tennis and fitness equipment. Life in the mountain of Stakevska is of high quality and is fully a place for hiking. The village is the best Bulgarian and European tourist destination for 2009, and its country is fully engaged in two protected areas in the European ecological network Nature 2000.
The houses are located on both sides of the river Stakevska and are interconnected through a multitude of bridges.
