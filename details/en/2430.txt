Protected area Pozharevo Islands is located between the Danube’s river shores between km 424 and 423, north of the village of Pozharevo and covered by woodlands. The main habitat on the island is a typical riverine forest of willow Salix spp. and White Poplar Populus alba with rich undergrowth. Every year the Danube floods the island, most often in the period February–April. Its banks are covered by sand strips.

It hosts one of the five biggest mixed colonies of Night Heron Nycticorax nycticoraх, and Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides in the country. In winter the island is regularly visited by two other globally threatened species – the Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus and the Red-breasted Goose Branta ruficollis. It is of international importance for several other wintering waterfowl species, especially Black-throated Diver Gavia arctica, Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Smew Mergus albellus and Greylag Goose Anser anser.
