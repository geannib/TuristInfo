The village 2nd of May has been founded in the year 1887, by Mihail Kogălniceanu. The name of the locality comes from the day of 2nd of May 1864 when A. I. Cuza dissolved the legislative meeting of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. From other sources, the name would come from the “two paddles”, peasant tools which were used in this establishment.
