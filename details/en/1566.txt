The official establishment of the the city Turnu, known today as Turnu Măgurele (was named like this to distinguish itself from Drobeta Turnu Severin and Turnu Roșu), was held on February 27th, 1836 during the reign of Alexandru Ghica. The plan of the city was developed by German engineer Karl Zohl, having the form of two circles almost touching inside, with three long boulevards formed one on the common diameter of the two circles and two of them on two outside tangent strings at the small circle, the streets starting like rays in the form of inner semicircles of the big circle, setting, thereby, the streets, the squares, the places for own buildings and places of house area. 
Turnu Magurele has in its administrative componence, also the two old neighborhoods of the settlement, Magurele and Odaia, as well as the new neighborhood Taberei (popularly known as "Catanga" because the raising of this neighborhood began in 1960 when in Africa, namely Katanga, in Zaire province, was in full armed conflict, extremely wild).
