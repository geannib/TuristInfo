In the north wall is revealed a hole through which is entered in the third hall with dimensions of 20, 15 width and height between 3 and 6 m. Here the cave reveals its unique beauty. There are all kinds of secondary formations - stalactites, stalagmites, corallites, sinter pots and lakes - colored in shades of yellow, brown and pale red. It follows a fourth room that resembles a maze made up of large boulders and stalactites almost adjacent. The bottom is covered with clay, and in some places - a strong sintered crust. In the lower side of the room - is the former lake, with specific formations like maces. From the ceiling are coming down conical stalactites, which include significant increased helicates.
