The Miikovtsi Eco-Alley reveals the natural attractions of the Balcan mountains from Elena-Tvarditsa. It starts near the area of Miikovtsi village located at less than 12 km from Elena. 

Very well-kept, the Miikovtsi Eco-Alley lays alongside Warm River at an altitude of 730 m. The climate and the warm days of the region offer an excellent environment for organising learning trips from early spring to late summer.  
 
The eco-alley is crossed by a lot of fast springs originating in the Balcan Mountins from Elena-Tvarditsa, offering a lot of swimming opportunities during the summer. Some of them host the Balcan barbell and the European chub. The numerous meadows invite to pick-nicks and relaxation close to the mountain springs.        
 
On the meadows there are strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, mushrooms and a wide variety of useful plants.  
 
Miykovtsi Village offers the possibility of accommodation. Nearby there is a ski slope and several routes leading to different chalets in the area.
