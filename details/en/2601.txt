Some of the vineyards are located on the famous Belogradchik rocks on the red sandy-rocky soil. 
Through theproject "The wines" were selected and offered two limited collections of wines from Borovitza collection, from the collection "Les Amis". Borovitsa winery is a member of the Association of independent producers in Bulgaria.
