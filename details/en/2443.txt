Since 2013, not only on the Black Sea coast, but also on the Danube was celebrated the day of July sun, which symbolizes a new beginning. The traditional feast for the north-eastern Bulgarian started near Varna in 1972 and in Tutrakan on the night of June 30 to July 1st, rock bands sing on the Bulgarian and Romanian shore, and at the sunrise everyone expects Uriah Heep's legendary song "July Morning". July Morning, as it is named on short, is celebrated only in Bulgaria and is connected to the hippie movement of the 1960s World. Today the celebration is associated more with a treatment by touching the water at sunrise in July, music and escape from the urban environment.
