The oak tree is the oldest tree in the oldest park in Bulgaria – The Danube Park in Silistra. The old oak as it is known to everyone was planted in 1910. It is believed that the park itself was founded in 1870 and in 1991 the park was declared a natural monument of natural importance.  In 2012 the oak tree became a law protected landmark because of its importance in the biological diversity and was registered in the century-old trees register. The trunk has a 1.2 circumference, 4.6 m from the ground to the crown and 14 m height.  The crown is 24 m in diameter. The tree is in good shape with healthy branches and completely covered roots. 
The century old tree nominated by Nevyana Marinova from Silistra, is the winner of the contest "Roots Tree 2015”, organised by the foundation "Environment Partnership". The old oak tree will represent Bulgaria in the European Competition “European Tree of 2016", competing with other 15 countries.
