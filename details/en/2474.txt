Air travel over the drive rivers near Silistra. Cessna planes and AH-2 are flying. Cessna is a single-engine four-seat aircraft which offers the best flight experience in terms of flight pleasure. During the flight a sense of freedom fills you and makes you feel the thrill of the flight. The plane will fly over the canyons and Suha river stones and the monasteries in Silistra. You will see rivers with amazing shapes coming from the rocks and then disappearing. You descend down between them, and then you go up to enjoy the view from the top. Incredible combination of familiarization trips and pleasure flying. When traveling with a line airplane the flight sensation is not the same.
