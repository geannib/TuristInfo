The temple is a basilica. Its construction began in 1865 on the site of an older church, but the construction is stopped several times; the building was demolished and built again. The church was completed and consecrated after the Liberation of Bulgaria. In 1974, it was rebuilt. There are no frescoes; a higher value is represented by the icon of St. Mary and Child, dating from the seventeenth century. In 2004 the icons of the iconostasis are painted.
