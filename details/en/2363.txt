The stone church from the Middle Ages Bulgarian dug into the cliff about 30 m above the river terrace. Located across the street from the bridge at the beginning of the village. The road leads to some stone stairs, then continued almost on rock. The church clearly defines three parts - entrance church and mortuary cell. On the floor are visible tombs carved into the rock. Par pits for graves that supported wooden exterior wall.
