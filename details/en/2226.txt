The established in 1919 Drama Theatre Ivan Radoev is located in the center of the pedestrian area. Ever since it has been established the theater has played an important part in the cultural life of Pleven and Bulgaria. The theater in Pleven was set up 84 years ago but its beginning should be traced in an earlier period – during the years of the National Revival, already in 1869 when the people whose inebriation and exaltation for culture was reborn and the citizens of Pleven used to put on stage “Long - suffering Genoveva” in the classrooms of the school St. Nikckolas.
