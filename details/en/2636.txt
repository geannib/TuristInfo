In 1879 in Vidin was founded the company for charity theatre "Vida". The first performances were held in so-called "National Caf√©" within the manorial neighborhood. The "Vida" theatre was built in 1891 with funds raised from the Organization for "Construction of Vida theatre", founded in 1887 by an initiative committee. This is the first building in the country, specially built to be a theater - a large lounge, ground floor, galleries, a large stage, orchestral and roof glass ceiling.
