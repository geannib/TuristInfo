The tower stands in the town square Byala city. It was designed a steeple of the old church of Byala, but this designation has not been fulfilled. It was built in 1872 with funds from the guild organization. On the southern side is carved an inscription in Church Slavonic language: "with peasant toil has been built this pillar for the bell to call the pious to God, June 19, 1872". On this side there is another inscription delimited by a rectangular area: Titor Veliku. Besides volunteering, for this building have been spent 13 000 grossi. The mechanism is donated by Lazar Payakov, then the Minister of Finance. Swiss production cost 25,000 gold leva.
For years, time was measured without major repairs.
