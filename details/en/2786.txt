Near the street of the Fire Brigade(or past Hristo Botev General Hospital) you reach the outskirts of the city at Zora nursing home for the elderly. The path takes you past an old limestone quarry and turns left crossing the bed of a small rivulet falling from the waterfall.v Then it climbs slightly and leads to a karst spring, where it crosses the rivulet once again and goes steeply up to the waterfall. Reaching its bottom, it makes a sharp left turn, climbs a very steep section past the entrance to a large but shallow cave and leads to a vast meadow in the upper part of the rock arch, where there is a rest point with benches and a table. The path turns right to the southwest across limestone pavements and leads to vast pastures with pens in Patleina locality. Up the rivulet it leads to a big karst spring with another rest point. A cart track takes you from here, climbing lightly up to the south-east to a fork in the road: a path leads to Parshevitsa Hut to the west-southwest and you have to keep the way onwards that climbs up to Tsarevo Livage locality and through Izbata and Kleno localities leads to the road to the monument on Mount Okolchitsa within tenminute walking distance.
