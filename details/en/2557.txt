The creator of Pavlikeni Zoo Park is Mr. Dimitar Yankov, and it all started in 1966 with a deer offered by the hunting team.  ater, even he - with his own work and initiative, decided to turn the site, the former scrap warehouse into a  Zoo-Park.  Over the years, the number and variety of animals grow considerably, to the delight of all - large and small, adults and children who voluntarily come here,and the Zoo-Park  has become a favorite place for residents of the small town, which often come to enjoy it.
