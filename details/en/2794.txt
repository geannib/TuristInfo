The trail is an excellent opportunity for visitors to combine outdoors fitness training with a nice walk in the mountain. There are five grounds with various fitness facilities along the trail and guides informing visitors about the recommendable exercises and proper amounts of training load. Up the highest point of the trail, there is a relaxation and meditation area. The trail links the Forest house (Gorski dom) with Kozloduy NPP mountain hotel and it is erected in such a way so that it can be passed in both directions.
