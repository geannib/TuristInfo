The remains of Roman military castle "Dimum" are located in the northern part of town of Belene (north of the "Vasil Levski" school). In the I-st century Dimum was a very important point of the Roman province of Moesia. Even during the regime of the first Roman Emperor Augustus the fortress was the most north-eastern point and boundary of the Roman province of Moesia and the Thracian kingdom. From the beginning of the II till the end of III a military horse camp was stationed here - part of the Roman army, which probably has built the fortress.
