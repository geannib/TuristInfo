The temple was built in 1983. Located in the central part of Cherven Bryag.
The iconostasis of the church "St. Sophronius of Vratsa" is the work of masters from Debar kind Filipovi. After the formation of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Filipovtsi often are called upon in these two free Bulgarian government units and around 1880 they settled permanently in the Principality. Filipovi made over 90 iconostasis scattered throughout the country in line with the unfolding after the liberation church construction. Filipovi work together - old hired job done are the projects and the performance was total, the profit was divided among all.
