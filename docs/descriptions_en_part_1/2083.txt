Antiquity fortress Tariza
The fortress rises in the north of the terrace plain, so-called "Yayla Mare". Its location dominates the surrounding land and is separated from the north and east of the sea, with a massive vertical rock over 20 meters high. This required the construction of defensive walls only from the west and south. With the land front against the west wall rises four solid towers, and in the eastern end of the south wall was placed a city gate. Inside the fortified settlement was discovered some of the main street, leading from the entrance to the city center, and a large building, which probably served as a visiting guard. Interest stone staircase is glued to one of the buldings indicating that it had two floors.

The exterior door was barred by lowering so-called cataracts, and internal - double door, closed with massive wooden beams. Above the entrance, which was vaulted, rises a tower on the door which offered better security gate and land around it.
