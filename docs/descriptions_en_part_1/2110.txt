In the center of Berkovitz you can take water from the Malinarka fountain.The fountain was built in 1967, made from Berkovitsa pink marble, in honor of the Malinarka girls that Ivan Vazov sang about in the poem "Raspberry". 
The inhabitants of Berkovitz insist that the fountain was dedicated to Malinarka there and only there. From the front of the clock tower, go left and continue down the street until you see the tap.
Ivan Vazov lived quite some time in Berkovitsa, as chairman of the district court of the city (March 1879-September 1880). The reason he came here is that doctors had detected the early stages of tuberculosis and advised him to go and live in the fresh air in this region.
Every evening, after he finished work, he went in his favorite walks in Berkovitsa, riding, in the mountains. On his way back, he met the girls of the city who were carrying baskets of freshly picked raspberries. Their beauty and their diligence have impressed him. The fountain has, also, his poem, "Raspberry".
Hold on, hold on berries
     those blue eyes
your basket is full
     with red raspberries.
From the dawn to prohibit
     with pink fingers
Also, and she sang to him
     among goritegasti.Â 
Indwelling, vacation 
    the dinner is cold:
Speech warm smile 
     The soul was hungry.
