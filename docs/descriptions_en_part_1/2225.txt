The Revival complex is the last place in Pleven which have preserved the architecture of the Revival period. It is situated at the very center of the town. Interesting fact about the complex is that rather than exposing history museum expositions, the local people and the town guests are welcomed by authentic home decoration and traditional Bulgarian cuisine in the taverns of the complex.
