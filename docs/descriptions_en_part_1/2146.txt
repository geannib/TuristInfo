Each year, around the date of September 17th, are the traditional days of the town of Lom. By a decision of the City Council of the Lom municipality, this holiday is selected as the Day of Love in Lom. This is the Christian celebration of the saints for faith, hope and love, and their mother - Sophia. They are the main religious virtues: wisdom, faith, hope and love.
Traditionally, during the festive day occurs the solemn Lliturgy for the health and happiness of the inhabitants, in the largest church "The Assumption of Vigin Mary".  As a mandatory element we have a solemn session of the Municipal Council, in which are awarded honorary titles of "Honorary Citizen of the city of Lom" and "Krusty Rodina" for outstanding achievements in various fields.
