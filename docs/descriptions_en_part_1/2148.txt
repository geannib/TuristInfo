The Feast of Mineral Water has more than a century. Officially the water is declared as healing in 1850. According to the preserved ,documents its organizers were the local elders and the church. Usually, all participants soften things into the miraculous fountain of health. For prayer, was elected the first day of July. Then the celebration moved next to a venerable tree, onto whose branches are hung hundreds of walking sticks. People come with them in Vrsac, and after several mineral baths hang them in the tree because they become useless. Only since the last mid-century, the festival is organised in the municipality.
